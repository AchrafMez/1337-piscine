# 1337 Med Pool 2023 â€“ My Experience

Just a brief overview of my *1337 Med Pool experience (2023)*.


### Pool?


**pool:** is a unique experience of 28 days filled with **hard work**, **stress**, and **fun moments** that I believe **everybody should give a try**.  
Whether you pass it or not, I'm sure youâ€™ll walk away knowing **something new about yourself**.

During these intense days, you build more than just technical skills you build **memories, and a good friendships**.

## A Few Words of Advice

A three necessary things that you should know:

### 1. Don't Compare Yourself to Others
Focus on your own progress. Everyone learns at a different pace.  
Aim to improve **your skills** day after day, that's what really matters.

### 2. Respect Your Peers  
Avoid conflicts. Getting into fights can lead to **serious trouble**, including being **kicked out** of the piscine. It might even cost you your second chance.

### 3. Never Cheat
Cheating will get you **blacklisted** from the school â€” permanently.  
No warnings. No second chances. Just don't do it.

## Finaly

I wonâ€™t tell you everything about the piscine â€” and thatâ€™s on purpose.

Because part of what makes the piscine so special is **discovering it for yourself**. The surprises, the challenges, the late nights, the breakthroughs. they all hit differently when you experience them firsthand.

So go in with an open mind, a strong heart, and a willingness to learn.
